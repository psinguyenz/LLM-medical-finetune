I consulted my doctor and UTI was ruled out. I consulted a urologist and she did an abdominal and pelvic CT scan and no structural abnormalities were found. No cystoscopy was performed. She diagnosed me as having an overactive bladder and gave me Trospium and I am taking Estrace and Clonazepam along with that. I have some relief since taking Trospium, but I have been having urethral discomfort. Is this possibly because of the Trospium? Would the CT scan have shown any problems with the urethra? I did a urine culture and blood test also.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",
        "reference": "Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. You have been diagnosed as OAB (overactive bladder) since you had lower urinary tract storage symptoms. You need one USG KUB (ultrasound of kidney, ureter and bladder) and PVR (post-void residue) to look for post-void residual urine. You need to undergo uroflowmetry to see whether you have obstructed voiding pattern or not. Urine CS (culture test) is also required to exclude UTI (urinary tract infection). If you do not have UTI or obstructed flow or increased PVR we can suspect your symptoms as OAB. Now you were rightly prescribed Tropsium. Estrogen cream also helps to vitalize the local tissue and decreases local tissue irritation, decreases dryness in the vagina and periurethral area. If your symptoms are still not controlled with anticholinergics, then we can add Mirabegron 50 mg. Timing may be adjusted according to the severity of your symptom complex. I would sincerely suggest you go to one urologist's office and get investigated and treated. I have tried to guide you regarding treatment options. You need to maintain a voiding diary too, ideally for seven days, but at least for three days to know the pattern of your water intake and voiding frequency and volume. It will help your urologist to understand your disease process in a better way. Urine CS, uroflowmetry, USG KUB, PVR, and serum creatinine.",
        "finetuned_response": "Hi, Thanks for your query. You had a history of UTI which is treated by antibiotics like Erythromycin or Ciprofloxacin. The symptoms you are having are due to the over active bladder. Urethral pain can be due to the inflammation in the urethra. It may be due to the infection in the urethra. You should consult a urologist and get done a routine examination like ultrasound abdomen and pelvis. If there is any obstruction in the urethra then it will cause the pain. So, you need to take the medicines like Estrase and Clonazepam. Hope I answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Regards, Dr. Ravi"

        "finetuned_response": "Hi, Thanks for your query. Kidney infection is usually caused by bacteria and it may lead to peritonitis which will cause abdominal pain and fever. You need to get blood routine test done to check for infection in abdomen. If there is no improvement after 2-3 weeks of treatment then you should consult with urologist and get ultrasound abdomen done. This will help you to know about the extent of infection and if there is any abscess formation or not. Once diagnosis is confirmed then you can start antibiotics like ampicillin, ciprofloxacin etc. For pain you can take paracetamol. Good luck."

He/she will examine you and may take a skin prick test to find out which allergen(s) are causing this problem. If there is no allergy, then you can try using antihistamines (e.g., Zyrtec) to help with itching. However, these drugs can cause drowsiness, so you need to use them only when you feel very sleepy. In addition, you might want to avoid foods that trigger your symptoms. For example, nuts, eggs, dairy products, soy, wheat, corn, and fish. Also, you should avoid certain medications such as aspirin, ibuprofen, and acetaminophen. Good luck!"

You did mention that you miss your son, which is very important. Having a child can be challenging, especially if you're not with them as much as you'd like. Here are some suggestions that might help:\n\n1. **Reach Out:** Reach out to people who care for children or those who may have gone through similar experiences. Sometimes, talking to someone who has experienced something similar can provide comfort.\n\n2. **Support Groups:** Consider joining support groups for parents of young children. These groups can offer advice, encouragement, and sometimes even financial assistance.\n\n3. **Talk About It:** If you're comfortable doing so, it would be helpful to talk about what you're going through with your son.
