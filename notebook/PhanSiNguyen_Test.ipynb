These algorithms use statistical techniques to make predictions or decisions with limited human intervention. They can be used for various tasks like image recognition, speech recognition, natural language processing, and more. Machine learning models can process large amounts of data quickly and accurately, making it possible to build intelligent applications that can adapt and respond to new inputs.\n",

The symptoms of the cold include sneezing, coughing, sore throat, headache, fever, muscle pain etc. You can use anti viral medicines like acyclovir, valacyclovir or famciclovir for treatment. You may also require over the counter medications such as antihistamines (for itching), decongestants (to reduce congestion) and analgesics (for pain relief). The best way to deal with the cold is by getting plenty of rest and fluids. Hope this helps! Regards, Dr Anjali Singh MD, FACP , Pulmonary Medicine, Cleveland Clinic,<|endoftext|>\n",

It usually starts with sneezing, watery eyes, sore throat, runny nose, cough, headache, fever etc. The duration of these symptoms may last from 1-2 weeks. If you do not have any other complication then there is no need for treatment as it will subside naturally. But if you get bacterial infection then antibiotics can be given in order to clear up infection. And if you develop pneumonia or bronchitis then further investigations like chest x-ray should be done to rule out complications. In case of high fever or difficulty breathing then antibiotics and antipyretics may be required. For persistent cough, use steam inhalation, hot water bottles over the back and neck area, gargling salt water, take honey etc. You may also require vitamin C supplements and fluids. Hope this helps!

This condition can be caused by alcoholism, diabetes or obesity; it also may develop as an aging process. The other causes include stress, kidney disease, sleep apnea, certain medications, smoking and some types of tumors. There are many factors that contribute to hypertension including genetics, age and gender. It is also important to note that being overweight or obese contributes to hypertension. The best way to determine if you have hypertension is through blood work and your doctor will tell you what level should be considered normal. I hope this answers your question.

Regular Exercise - The best way to avoid heart diseases is regular exercise like jogging or cycling. If you do not have access to gym then walk regularly around your home. 2. Balanced Diet - Include more fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, seeds, legumes, milk and dairy products in your diet. Avoid high cholesterol foods. 3. Manage Your Stress Level - Stress is one of the major causes for many health issues including heart diseases. Meditation or yoga will help manage stress levels effectively. 4. Quit Smoking - Smoking increases the risk of heart diseases. 5. Get Regular Checkups done with your doctor. This will ensure that there is no hidden problem. If any of these suggestions do not work then please consult a doctor for further treatment. Thank you for writing to us.

Tê và ngứa ran ở tay có thể do nhiều nguyên nhân khác nhau như: - Trong trường hợp này, nguyên nhân có thể là do nhiễm trùng, viêm mạn, hoặc các bệnh lý khác. - Nếu bạn đang gặp phải tình trạng này, hãy liên hệ với bác sĩ để được tư vấn cụ thể hơn. 2. Bạn nên đi khám bác sĩ để được tư vấn về nguyên nhân gây ra hiện tượng này. 3. Bác sĩ sẽ chỉ định một số xét nghiệm để xác định nguyên nhân gây ra hiện tượng này. 4. Bác sĩ cũng sẽ đề xuất một số phương pháp điều trị phù hợp để giúp bạn cải thiện tình trạng sức khỏe của mình. 5. Ngoài ra, bạn cũng cần chú ý đến chế độ ăn uống hàng ngày, tập luyện thể dục đều đặn, và tránh tiếp xúc với môi trường ô nhiễm. 6.

        "- Chất lượng tổng quát hóa: Validation Loss giảm từ 1.71 xuống 1.5378, cho thấy mô hình đã học được các mẫu mới và có khả năng tổng quát hóa tốt.\n",

        "- Perplexity (PPL): Đạt mức 4.6545, là một con số rất khả quan đối với một mô hình 1.5B, xác nhận mô hình có độ tự tin cao trong việc dự đoán văn bản y tế.\n",

        "2. Tối ưu kỹ thuật\n",
        "- Tối ưu VRAM: Việc sử dụng LoRA 4-bit quantization thành công giúp giảm đáng kể lượng VRAM cần thiết, cho phép quá trình Fine-tuning diễn ra trên phần cứng GPU có bộ nhớ hạn chế.\n",

        "[Điền bài học của bạn]\n",
        "- Ưu tiên VRAM (QLoRA): Đối với LLM, việc kiểm soát VRAM là yếu tố quan trọng để tối ưu hóa về thời gian cũng như chi phí\n",
